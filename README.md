## Project: Text-based game: The Minotaur's Labyrinth

This game consists of a recreation of the Greek myth of the Minotaur maze. It's a basic labyrinth game but I have added some things to make it more interesting. First, I will tell a brief story of Daedalus and king Minos and after that I will create a two-dimensional list which the user cannot see. The user will move in the maze and will find walls, they must remember the route because if they find the minotaur they must start over again. There will be a timer and a score depending on how many moves the user has done before arriving to the exit.
